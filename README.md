# Monkey-Surf
INTRODUCTION:
The proposed project involves the development of a simple and entertaining game titled 
"Monkey Surf." The game is designed to provide users with an engaging experience as they 
control a monkey character through a dynamically changing environment. The monkey's 
objective is to navigate through a series of obstacles represented by trees while accumulating 
points.


OVERVIEW:
"Monkey Surf" is a side-scrolling game where players control a monkey that can perform jumps 
to avoid obstacles, particularly trees. The game will incorporate computer vision to detect 
player actions, making it an innovative and interactive experience.


FEATURES:
• Real-time Action Detection:
The game utilizes a computer vision system to detect real-time actions of the player using a 
camera. This includes capturing images, processing them, and interpreting the actions to 
control the monkey in the game.
• Obstacle Avoidance:
The monkey must navigate through a series of randomly generated trees. The player's actions, 
such as jumping, are crucial for avoiding collisions with these obstacles.
• Scoring System:
Players will be scored based on their performance, including the number of obstacles avoided 
and the distance covered. A scoring display will be integrated into the game interface.
• Interactive Introduction:
The game will feature an engaging introduction screen, prompting users to press the spacebar 
to start the game.
• Deep Learning Model:
A pre-trained deep learning model will be incorporated into the game to predict player actions 
based on captured images. This model will be trained using images of actions such as jumping 
and doing nothing.


IMPLEMENTATION:
• Programming Language:
The game will be implemented using Python, utilizing the pygame library for game 
development, OpenCV for computer vision, and Keras for deep learning.
• Object-Oriented Design:
The code will be organized using an object-oriented approach with separate classes for the 
game, monkey character, trees, and the deep learning model.
• Real-time Photo Capture:
The program will continuously capture real-time images through the camera and use them for 
action detection.
• Computer Vision:
OpenCV will be employed for image processing and detecting player actions. The game will 
react to actions such as jumps and apply them to the monkey character.


TECHNICAL STACK:
• Programming Language: Python
• Game Development Library: Pygame
• Computer Vision Library: OpenCV
• Deep Learning Framework: Keras (for model creation and training)
• Image Processing Library: PIL (Pillow)


GAME FLOW
1. The game starts with an introduction screen prompting the user to begin by pressing the 
spacebar.
2. Once initiated, the main game loop begins, featuring a scrolling background and the 
monkey character.
3. Randomly generated trees act as obstacles, and the user must navigate the monkey to 
avoid collisions.
4. The computer vision component captures the user's gestures through the webcam to 
trigger the monkey's actions, such as jumping.
5. The game keeps track of the player's score based on successful navigation through 
obstacles.
6. The game concludes when a collision occurs, and the final score is displayed.


EXPECTED OUTCOME:
The "Monkey Surf" game aims to deliver an enjoyable and interactive gaming experience. By 
combining traditional game development techniques with computer vision, the project 
introduces a unique element of user interaction. The goal is to create a fun and accessible game 
that can be enjoyed by users of various skill levels.


Conclusion:
"Monkey Surf" is an exciting and interactive game that merges traditional side-scrolling 
gameplay with cutting-edge computer vision technology. The proposed features aim to create 
an engaging user experience, making the game suitable for a wide audience
